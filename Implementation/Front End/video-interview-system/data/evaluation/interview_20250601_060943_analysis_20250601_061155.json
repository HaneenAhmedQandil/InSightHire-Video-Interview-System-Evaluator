  "transcript": "I don't know too much about this. A lot of people knew that the features of the song are in response. So we need to translate them to vectors to be able to train and make different or machine learning models train on them. So we have to back those for this. And we can integrate something like I think MFCC to find TUNE. We find TUNE the hyperparameter like dropout and this hyperparameter.",
