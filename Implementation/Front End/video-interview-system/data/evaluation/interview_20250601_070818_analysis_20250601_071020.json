Before going into any of the processing or can we after processing people going into any training or testing to extract the features on the sound. This can be done by transformers like MFCC, we can extract the features and then make an embedding on these extract features and then use these embeddings to be fed into the architecture like CNN or LSTM or LSTM to product the classes and this production can be evaluated by evaluation materials like LSTM functions and a TORC record if one score and",
