  "transcript": "Okay. Ragn improve answer evaluation compared to using WNLM. Why is this doing so? WNLM like GRIPITI for example or any LM when you give it a question to evaluate an answer for example. And you want to search for many many thousands of documents. You will give it all these documents at once and there will be a large very large very very large context window and it may have a Sunit. But Ragn solves this problem by only retrieving the relevant document the top K relevant documents and only the documents will be given to the LM to evaluate the answer. Not the thousands of documents. So it is better.",
