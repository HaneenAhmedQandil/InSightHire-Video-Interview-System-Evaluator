What is regression? Which models can you use to solve a regression problem?,Regression is a part of supervised ML. Regression models investigate the relationship between a dependent (target) and independent variable (s) (predictor). Here are some common regression models - Linear Regression establishes a linear relationship between target and predictor (s). It predicts a numeric value and has a shape of a straight line. - Polynomial Regression has a regression equation with the power of independent variable more than 1. It is a curve that fits into the data points. - Ridge Regression helps when predictors are highly correlated (multicollinearity problem). It penalizes the squares of regression coefficients but doesnt allow the coefficients to reach zeros (uses L2 regularization). - Lasso Regression penalizes the absolute values of regression coefficients and allows some of the coefficients to reach absolute zero (thereby allowing feature selection).,Clarity,80,The explanation is mostly clear but could be better organized for easier understanding.,82.14

What are the main assumptions of linear regression?,"There are several assumptions of linear regression. If any of them is violated, model predictions and interpretation may be worthless or misleading. 1. Linear relationship between features and target variable. 2. Additivity means that the effect of changes in one of the features on the target variable does not depend on values of other features. For example, a model for predicting revenue of a company have of two features - the number of items _a_ sold and the number of items _b_ sold. When company sells more items _a_ the revenue increases and this is independent of the number of items _b_ sold. But, if customers who buy _a_ stop buying _b_, the additivity assumption is violated. 3. Features are not correlated (no collinearity) since it can be difficult to separate out the individual effects of collinear features on the target variable. 4. Errors are independently and identically normally distributed (y i = B0 + B1*x1 i + ... + error i ): 1. No correlation between errors (consecutive errors in the case of time series data). 2. Constant variance of errors - homoscedasticity. For example, in case of time series, seasonal patterns can increase errors in seasons with higher activity. 3. Errors are normally distributed, otherwise some features will have more influence on the target variable than to others. If the error distribution is significantly non-normal, confidence intervals may be too wide or too narrow.",Clarity,75,The answer is mostly clear but some parts could be better structured for comprehension.,81.42857142857143

If you can fit the bell-shaped ""normal"" curve to the histogram, then the hypothesis that the underlying random variable follows the normal distribution can not be rejected. 2. Check Skewness and Kurtosis of the sampled data. Skewness = 0 and kurtosis = 3 are typical for a normal distribution, so the farther away they are from these values, the more non-normal the distribution. 3. Use Kolmogorov-Smirnov or/and Shapiro-Wilk tests for normality. They take into account both Skewness and Kurtosis simultaneously. 4. Check for Quantile-Quantile plot. It is a scatterplot created by plotting two sets of quantiles against one another.

"What is ""curse of dimensionality""?","The curse of dimensionality is an issue that arises when working with high-dimensional data. It is often said that ""the curse of dimensionality"" is one of the main problems with machine learning. The curse of dimensionality refers to the fact that, as the number of dimensions (features) in a data set increases, the number of data points required to accurately learn the relationships between those features increases exponentially.

Which hyper-parameter tuning strategies (in general) do you know?,"There are several strategies for hyper-tuning but I would argue that the three most popular nowadays are the following: Grid Search is an exhaustive approach such that for each hyper-parameter, the user needs to manually give a list of values for the algorithm to try. After these values are selected, grid search then evaluates the algorithm using each and every combination of hyper-parameters and returns the combination that gives the optimal result (i.e. lowest MAE). Because grid search evaluates the given algorithm using all combinations, it's easy to see that this can be quite computationally expensive and can lead to sub-optimal results specifically since the user needs to specify specific values for these hyper-parameters, which is prone for error and requires domain knowledge. Random Search is similar to grid search but differs in the sense that rather than specifying which values to try for each hyper-parameter, an upper and lower bound of values for each hyper-parameter is given instead. With uniform probability, random values within these bounds are then chosen and similarly, the best combination is returned to the user. Although this seems less intuitive, no domain knowledge is necessary and theoretically much more of the parameter space can be explored. * In a completely different framework, Bayesian Optimization is thought of as a more statistical way of optimization and is commonly used when using neural networks, specifically since one evaluation of a neural network can be computationally costly. In numerous research papers, this method heavily outperforms Grid Search and Random Search and is currently used on the Google Cloud Platform as well as AWS. Because an in-depth explanation requires a heavy background in bayesian statistics and gaussian processes (and maybe even some game theory), a ""simple"" explanation is that a much simpler/faster acquisition function intelligently chooses (using a surrogate function such as probability of improvement or GP-UCB) which hyper-parameter values to try on the computationally expensive, original algorithm. Using the result of the initial combination of values on the expensive/original function, the acquisition function takes the result of the expensive/original algorithm into account and uses it as its prior knowledge to again come up with another set of hyper-parameters to choose during the next iteration. This process continues either for a specified number of iterations or for a specified amount of time and similarly the combination of hyper-parameters that performs the best on the expensive/original algorithm is chosen.",Clarity,75,The answer provides clear descriptions but is dense and may confuse some readers.,80.0

How we can initialize the weights of a neural network?,"Proper initialization of weight matrix in neural network is very necessary. Simply we can say there are two ways for initializations. 1. Initializing weights with zeroes. Setting weights to zero makes your network no better than a linear model.

Initializing weights randomly. Assigning random values to weights is better than just 0 assignment. a) If weights are initialized with very high values the term np.dot(W,X)+b becomes significantly higher and if an activation function like sigmoid() is applied, the function maps its value near to 1 where the slope of gradient changes slowly and learning takes a lot of time. b) If weights are initialized with low values it gets mapped to 0, where the case is the same as above.

For example, in PyTorch you can use a function called StepLR which decays the learning rate of each parameter by value gamma-which we have to pass through argument- after n number of epoch which you can also set through function argument named epoch_size.",Engagement,75,The answer is informative but not especially engaging or attention-grabbing.,79.28571428571429

What is transfer learning? How does it work?,"Given a source domain D_S and learning task T_S, a target domain D_T and learning task T_T, transfer learning aims to help improve the learning of the target predictive function f_T in D_T using the knowledge in D_S and T_S, where D_S D_T,or T_S T_T. In other words, transfer learning enables to reuse knowledge coming from other domains or learning tasks. In the context of CNNs, we can use networks that were pre-trained on popular datasets such as ImageNet. We then can use the weights of the layers that learn to represent features and combine them with a new set of layers that learns to map the feature representations to the given classes. Two popular strategies are either to freeze the layers that learn the feature representations completely, or to give them a smaller learning rate.",Clarity,80,The explanation is generally clear but contains some technical jargon that may not be easily understood by all readers.,84.29

What is collaborative filtering?,"Collaborative filtering is the most prominent approach to generate recommendations. It uses the wisdom of the crowd, i.e. it gives recommendations based on the experience of others. A recommendation is calculated as the average of other experiences. Say we want to give a score that indicates how much user u will like an item i. Then we can calculate it with the experience of N other users U as r_ui = 1/N sum(v in U) r_vi. In order to rate similar experiences with a higher weight, we can introduce a similarity between users that we use as a multiplier for each rating. Also, as users have an individual profile, one user may have an average rating much larger than another user, so we use normalization techniques (e.g. centering or Z-score normalization) to remove the users' biases. Collaborative filtering does only need a rating matrix as input and improves over time. However, it does not work well on sparse data, does not work for cold starts (see below) and usually tends to overfit.",Clarity,75,The explanation is generally clear but includes technical terms that may not be comprehensible to all readers.,80.0

Say we want to give a score that indicates how much user u will like an item i. Then we can calculate it with the experience of N other users U as r_ui = 1/N sum(v in U) r_vi. In order to rate similar experiences with a higher weight, we can introduce a similarity between users that we use as a multiplier for each rating. Also, as users have an individual profile, one user may have an average rating much larger than another user, so we use normalization techniques (e.g. centering or Z-score normalization) to remove the users' biases. Collaborative filtering does only need a rating matrix as input and improves over time. However, it does not work well on sparse data, does not work for cold starts (see below) and usually tends to overfit.",Engagement,65,The technical nature of the response may not maintain the interest of all readers.,80.0
"How we can incorporate implicit feedback (clicks, etc) into our recommender systems?","In comparison to explicit feedback, implicit feedback datasets lack negative examples. For example, explicit feedback can be a positive or a negative rating, but implicit feedback may be the number of purchases or clicks. One popular approach to solve this problem is named weighted alternating least squares (wALS) [Hu, Y., Koren, Y., & Volinsky, C. (2008, December). Collaborative filtering for implicit feedback datasets. In Data Mining, 2008. ICDM'08. Eighth IEEE International Conference on (pp. 263-272). IEEE.].
