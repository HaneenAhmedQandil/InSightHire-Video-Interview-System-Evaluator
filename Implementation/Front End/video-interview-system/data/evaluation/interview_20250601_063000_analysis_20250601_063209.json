  "transcript": "I see on Structle of Criticism as an opportunity to grow not as a personal tech. I try to listen carefully, ask a question if I need clarification and reflect on how I can apply the feedback to improve. I in one of my internships I was tasked with creating a client report after submitting the efforts draft. My supervisor told me that while the data was accurate, the formatting and instruction made it hard to read. As far as the tools are bad this appointed me because I had caught a lot of time and to add, but I reminded myself that the feedback was meant to help me not discourage me. I asked for specific suggestions, then I talked to a research example of effective reports. I revised my draft, based on feedback, and second version was better received.",
