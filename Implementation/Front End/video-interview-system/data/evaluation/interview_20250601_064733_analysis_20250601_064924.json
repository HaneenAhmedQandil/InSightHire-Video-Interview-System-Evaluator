  "transcript": "I'm a student at the British University in Egypt and I'm a senior AI student. And again, of my life at university, we're sure I have raised a conflict in the team. And at the end, it was a very good and the problem was that we were being lived in the line. So I have communicated them and we managed the time between us. What I have done is from this and to learn how to communicate and convince others with your opinion. Even if you are honest in the same speech. And if they are honest and honest, you can talk.",
