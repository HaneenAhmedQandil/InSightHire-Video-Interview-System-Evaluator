For example, I have used MFCC in my gradation project. It was from two extract features, very little features. Then feed it to the network like CNN, LSTM, Olvail, LSTM and all of these. The other ones are male spectrogram and log-mell. They can be used also. Each one of them has a Southern Conte and trending grad application. You want to do your tools and the app...",
