  "transcript": "To implement the transformer-based feature recognition, Emotion recognition, the transformer can be used for feature extraction sources before the features are fed into the LLM itself, sorry, the network or the model itself. So it can be used to extract special features and convert it into the frequency, convert it into something that the computer can understand, like vectors, and these vectors are in the embedding, that will be fed to the architecture, and then apply and train the model on it, and the product classes and disc classes will be evaluated.",
