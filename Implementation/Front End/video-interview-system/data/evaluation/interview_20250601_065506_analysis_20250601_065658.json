  "transcript": "Okay, if I have a pre-trend work to work with a new notion that's pretty much what I will. Firstly, remote the noise from the website. I can use make data augmentation techniques and like a stretching or shafting. As after this I would use Web2Vec. So I will have better generalization and I can convert the waveforms to vector force to be able to work and train the different models on it.",
