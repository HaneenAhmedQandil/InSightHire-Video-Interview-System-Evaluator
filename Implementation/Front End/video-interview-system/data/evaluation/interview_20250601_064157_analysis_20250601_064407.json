  "transcript": "I'll implement a transformer. This feature emotional recognition transformer can be used in extracting the features of the sound before feeding the feature to the network. So one thing can be used as MFCC. The feature can be extracted and filled in an embedding. And this embedding can be then as fast to the network like CNN, LSTM or LSTM, two three in on that and extract or pressify the third classes. And then the results are either with it using a confusion matrix and classification report",
