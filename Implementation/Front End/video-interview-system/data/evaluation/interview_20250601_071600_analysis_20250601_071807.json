Before feeding the features into the network we can use MTCC to extract the features and convert it to embeddings and this embeddings can be fed into the neural network or something like an LSTM, by the StMO, CNLs and then to train them and to protect classes. This class of can be very easy to use and use in 3D like plus functions and accuracy.",
