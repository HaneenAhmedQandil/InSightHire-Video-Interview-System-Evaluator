  "transcript": "One of my greats, the stresses is my ability to learn quickly and adapt to new technologies. And fast evolving fields like machine learning and speech processing, this crucial. For example, when I started working with Transformer based modus legs with Tobak, I quickly got up to speed my sudden dark textures, experimenting with pre-train modus and fine tuning them for specific downstream tasks. Another key strength is my structured problem solving mindset. I break down complex tasks like building a machine, a locomotion system and 12 defined stages, which are data cleaning modus selection, training, evaluation and iteration. This helps me to organize and deliver reproducible results. Finally, I would say communication and collaboration are strength, are strength is i value. I make a point to document my work, and clearly discuss ideas openly with teammates, which had helped avoid blockers and speed of product timelines. Finally, our sorry time. These traffic align well with this role where track and complex speech are all zero.",
