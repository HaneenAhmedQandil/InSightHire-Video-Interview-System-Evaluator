  "transcript": "If I have a large data set for audio recordings, there are many feature reconstruction techniques that can be used by my respective spectrogram, log my specific program, add MFCC. Each of them has pros and cons. For example, MFCC can be used to extract special features and these features can be fed into the model later on to see the product classes. And these classes can be evaluated by using a variation matrix like loss function and accuracy, FIS score and record and all of these.",
