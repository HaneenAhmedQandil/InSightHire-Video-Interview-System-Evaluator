  "transcript": "To find T1A-P8-Trend Wave to Web to model on a new Emotion and Speech Data Set, I would follow structured approach across three stages, data preprocessing, training and hyperparameter tuning. First, data preprocessing. I ensure all audio is in a uniform format, typically 16kKW. I ensure that the data is in a uniform format, I ensure that the data is in a uniform format, I ensure that the data is in a uniform format, I ensure that the data is in a uniform format, I ensure that the data is in a uniform format, I ensure that the data is in a uniform format, I ensure that the data is in a uniform format, I ensure that the data is in a uniform format, The second point is training loop. I load pre-trend Wave to Web to model, pre-the feature extractor initially and add classification head on top. The model is trained using cross-entropy loss with class balance sampling of the data set in balance. I use common tools like PoyTorch, Light & Warhugging Face Trainer for efficient training and applying airlestopping and gradient clapping to avoid overfitting or instability. The final part is hyperparameter tuning. Key parameters include learning rate, small starts and small and best starts limited by GPU memory and number of frozen and frozen layers. I may unfreeze more layer gradually.",
