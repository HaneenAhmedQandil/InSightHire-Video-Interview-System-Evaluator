I have worked with such feature-technique structures and techniques made and Reck-Malice Book of Ram, the lab-Mal and FCC. Each of them has a person count and feature-emotional recognition tasks. MFCC, I guess, is like a transformer-based, secret-struction technique that can be used before fitting the features into the network.
