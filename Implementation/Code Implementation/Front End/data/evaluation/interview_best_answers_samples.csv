question,answer
Tell me about yourself.,"Certainly, I'd be happy to tell you about myself. Currently, I am working as a project coordinator at XYZ Corp, where I have successfully led several key initiatives to streamline operations and enhance team collaboration. This experience has honed my skills in project management, communication, and strategic planning, all of which are integral to the position we're discussing today. However, before I dive deeper into my qualifications, I would love to gain a clearer understanding of the specific priorities and goals you have for this role. This way, I can ensure that my background aligns closely with your needs. Could you share more about what the most critical aspects of this position are? Additionally, are there any particular challenges or objectives that need immediate attention or long-term focus? 

Once I understand your priorities better, I can share examples of how I've successfully tackled similar challenges in my past roles. For instance, if problem-solving and adaptability are crucial, I can elaborate on how I developed a contingency plan that reduced project delays by 30% during a major system upgrade. I'm eager to connect my experiences and skills directly to the success of your team and organization."
What are your greatest strengths?,"In preparing for this role, I've identified that your team values dedication, good communication, and a proven track record of achievement. One of my greatest strengths is my dedication to consistently deliver high-quality results. In my previous position, I led a project that required significant coordination and communication among different departments. By streamlining processes and fostering open communication, we successfully completed the project ahead of schedule, resulting in a 20% increase in efficiency. This experience honed my ability to communicate effectively across teams and demonstrated my commitment to achieving excellence. Additionally, I am known for my positive attitude and sense of humor, which helps me build strong relationships with colleagues and contribute to a supportive work environment. I am confident that these strengths align well with your team’s needs and would be an asset in this role."
What are your greatest weaknesses?,"(and another reason it's so important to get a thorough description of your interviewer's needs before you answer questions): Assure the interviewer that you can think of nothing that would stand in the way of your performing in this position with excellence. Then, quickly review you strongest qualifications. Example: Nobody's perfect, but based on what you've told me about this position, I believe I' d make an outstanding match. I know that when I hire people, I look for two things most of all. Do they have the qualifications to do the job well, and the motivation to do it well? Everything in my background shows I have both the qualifications and a strong desire to achieve excellence in whatever I take on. So I can say in all honesty that I see nothing that would cause you even a small concern about my ability or my strong desire to perform this job with excellence. Alternate strategy (if you don't yet know enough about the position to talk about such a perfect fit): Instead of confessing a weakness, describe what you like most and like least, making sure that what you like most matches up with the most important qualification for success in the position, and what you like least is not essential. Example: Let's say you're applying for a teaching position. If given a choice, I like to spend as much time as possible in front of my prospects selling, as opposed to shuffling paperwork back at the office. Of course, I long ago learned the importance of filing paperwork properly, and I do it conscientiously. But what I really love to do is sell (if your interviewer were a sales manager, this should be music to his ears.)"
Tell me about something you did or failed to do that you now feel a little ashamed of.,"You know, I really can't think of anything that I've done or failed to do that I feel ashamed of. (Pause) I would add that as a general management principle, I've found that the best way to avoid regrets is to avoid causing them in the first place. I practice one habit that helps me greatly in this regard. At the end of each day, I mentally review the day's events and conversations to take a second look at the people and developments I'm involved with and do a double-check of what they're likely to be feeling. Sometimes I'll see things that do need more follow-up, whether it's offering a pat on the back or maybe a five-minute chat in someone's office to ensure clarity on certain matters. I also like to make each person feel like a member of an elite team, akin to the Boston Celtics or LA Lakers in their prime. I've found that when you let each team member know you expect excellence in their performance, work hard to set an example yourself, and make it clear that you appreciate and respect their feelings, it results in a highly motivated group. It's a team that's having fun at work because they're striving for excellence rather than brooding over slights or regrets."
Why are you leaving (or did you leave) this position?,"Currently, I am employed at XYZ Corporation, where I've had the opportunity to develop my skills in project management and collaborate with a talented team. However, I am exploring new opportunities because I'm eager to advance into roles that offer greater responsibility and potential for growth. From what I've learned about your company, it seems that you value innovation and provide substantial opportunities for professional development, which aligns well with my career aspirations.

In my previous role at ABC Company, I was part of a division-wide layoff due to a strategic merger that shifted the company’s focus. I understood the business rationale behind the decision and appreciated the transparency with which it was communicated. This experience has given me valuable insights into organizational change and adaptability, and I am excited to bring this perspective to a forward-thinking company like yours."
The Silent Treatment,"Like a primitive tribal mask, the Silent Treatment loses all it power to frighten you once you refuse to be intimidated. If your interviewer pulls it, keep quiet yourself for a while and then ask, with sincere politeness and not a trace of sarcasm, Is there anything else I can fill in on that point? Thats all there is to it. Whatever you do, dont let the Silent Treatment intimidate you into talking a blue streak, because you could easily talk yourself out of the position."
Why should I hire you?,"By now you can see how critical it is to apply the overall strategy of uncovering the employers needs before you answer questions. If you know the employers greatest needs and desires, this question will give you a big leg up over other candidates because you will give him better reasons for hiring you than anyone else is likely to...reasons tied directly to his needs. Whether your interviewer asks you this question explicitly or not, this is the most important question of your interview because he must answer this question favorably in is own mind before you will be hired. So help him out! Walk through each of the positions requirements as you understand them, and follow each with a reason why you meet that requirement so well. Example: As I understand your needs, you are first and foremost looking for someone who can manage the sales and marketing of your book publishing division. As youve said you need someone with a strong background in trade book sales. This is where Ive spent almost all of my career, so Ive chalked up 18 years of experience exactly in this area. I believe that I know the right contacts, methods, principles, and successful management techniques as well as any person can in our industry. You also need someone who can expand your book distribution channels. In my prior post, my innovative promotional ideas doubled, then tripled, the number of outlets selling our books. Im confident I can do the same for you. You need someone to give a new shot in the arm to your mail order sales, someone who knows how to sell in space and direct mail media. Here, too, I believe I have exactly the experience you need. In the last five years, Ive increased our mail order book sales from $600,000 to $2,800,000, and now were the countrys second leading marketer of scientific and medical books by mail. Etc., etc., etc., Every one of these selling couplets (his need matched by your qualifications) is a touchdown that runs up your score. IT is your best opportunity to outsell your competition."
Arent you overqualified for this position?,"As with any objection, dont view this as a sign of imminent defeat. Its an invitation to teach the interviewer a new way to think about this situation, seeing advantages instead of drawbacks. Example: I recognize the job market for what it is a marketplace. Like any marketplace, its subject to the laws of supply and demand. So overqualified can be a relative term, depending on how tight the job market is. And right now, its very tight. I understand and accept that. I also believe that there could be very positive benefits for both of us in this match. Because of my unusually strong experience in ________________ , I could start to contribute right away, perhaps much faster than someone whod have to be brought along more slowly. Theres also the value of all the training and years of experience that other companies have invested tens of thousands of dollars to give me. Youd be getting all the value of that without having to pay an extra dime for it. With someone who has yet to acquire that experience, hed have to gain it on your nickel. I could also help you in many things they dont teach at the Harvard Business School. For example...(how to hire, train, motivate, etc.) When it comes to knowing how to work well with people and getting the most out of them, theres just no substitute for what you learn over many years of front-line experience. You company would gain all this, too. From my side, there are strong benefits, as well. Right now, I am unemployed. I want to work, very much, and the position you have here is exactly what I love to do and am best at. Ill be happy doing this work and thats what matters most to me, a lot more that money or title. Most important, Im looking to make a long term commitment in my career now. Ive had enough of job-hunting and want a permanent spot at this point in my career. I also know that if I perform this job with excellence, other opportunities cannot help but open up for me right here. In time, Ill find many other ways to help this company and in so doing, help myself. I really am looking to make a long-term commitment. NOTE: The main concern behind the overqualified question is that you will leave your new employer as soon as something better comes your way. Anything you can say to demonstrate the sincerity of your commitment to the employer and reassure him that youre looking to stay for the long-term will help you overcome this objection."
Where do you see yourself five years from now?,"I am definitely interested in making a long-term commitment to my next position, and I am excited about the prospect of joining your team. Based on what you've described about this role, it aligns perfectly with my skills and experiences, and it offers the challenges and opportunities that I am looking for. I believe that if I consistently perform my duties with excellence, future opportunities will naturally arise. This has always been the case in my career, where hard work and dedication have led to growth and advancement, and I am confident that I will have similar opportunities here."
"Describe your ideal company, location and job.","My ideal company is one that values innovation and collaboration, much like the one you're representing. The dedication to fostering creativity and teamwork here is evident, and it aligns perfectly with my professional aspirations. I am particularly drawn to the company's commitment to sustainable practices and community engagement, which resonate with my personal values and desire to contribute positively to the environment and society. 

Furthermore, the location is ideal for someone like me who thrives in a community-oriented environment. Being based in Topeka offers a unique blend of professional opportunities and a close-knit community that I find incredibly appealing. I am eager to immerse myself in a setting where I can build strong relationships, both professionally and personally. The chance to be part of a growing industry here excites me, as I am looking forward to contributing to and witnessing the evolution and success of the company within this vibrant area."
Why do you want to work at our company?,"I am thrilled about the opportunity to join your company because of its innovative approach to sustainable solutions, as highlighted in your recent annual report. Your commitment to reducing carbon emissions aligns with my passion for environmental stewardship, and I am eager to contribute to projects that make a tangible impact. Additionally, I've spoken with a colleague who has worked with your team on a collaborative project, and they shared how your dynamic work culture encourages creativity and collaboration. This aligns perfectly with my professional values and aspirations, making your company the ideal place for me to grow and contribute meaningfully."
What are your career options right now?,"Prepare for this question by thinking of how you can position yourself as a desired commodity. If you are still working, describe the possibilities at your present firm and why, though youre greatly appreciated there, youre looking for something more (challenge, money, responsibility, etc.). Also mention that youre seriously exploring opportunities with one or two other firms. If youre not working, you can talk about other employment possibilities youre actually exploring. But do this with a light touch, speaking only in general terms. You dont want to seem manipulative or coy."
Why have you been out of work so long?,"After my previous position was terminated, I deliberately chose not to rush into the first available opportunities. I believe it's important to turn challenges into opportunities, and I wanted to make sure my next career step aligned with my strengths and passions. This period allowed me to deeply reflect on what I do best and what I truly want from my career. I took the time to identify companies that match my values and offer the kind of work environment I am seeking. Additionally, the economic conditions in the industry have been challenging, with many companies undergoing consolidation and stabilization, which has naturally extended the job search process. By being selective and patient, I am confident that when I find the right fit, both the company and I will benefit from this careful evaluation process."
"Tell me honestly about the strong points and weak points of your boss (company, management team, etc.)...","I feel fortunate to have worked with a boss and management team that truly valued collaboration and open communication. My boss has a strong ability to inspire and motivate the team, consistently fostering an environment where innovative ideas are welcomed and appreciated. The management team is proactive in supporting professional growth, always encouraging us to pursue opportunities for development and learning. This supportive atmosphere has made a significant positive impact on my career and personal development. Overall, their dedication to creating a positive and thriving workplace culture is something I truly admire."
What good books have you read lately?,"Unless youre up for a position in academia or as book critic for The New York Times, youre not expected to be a literary lion. But it wouldnt hurt to have read a handful of the most recent and influential books in your profession and on management. Consider it part of the work of your job search to read up on a few of these leading books. But make sure they are quality books that reflect favorably upon you, nothing that could even remotely be considered superficial. Finally, add a recently published bestselling work of fiction by a world-class author and youll pass this question with flying colors."
Tell me about a situation when your work was criticized.,"Throughout my career, I have consistently received positive feedback and my performance reviews have been excellent. While I strive for perfection, I am always open to suggestions for improvement. Early in my career, I received feedback about my time management skills. I was working on multiple projects and occasionally found it challenging to prioritize tasks effectively. This constructive criticism prompted me to explore strategies for better organization, such as using project management tools and setting clear milestones. As a result, my ability to manage my workload has become one of my strongest skills, contributing to my efficiency and effectiveness in my roles. 

In a more recent position, I received feedback on my presentation style, which was deemed slightly too detailed for certain audiences. While this was not critical to my overall success, I took it as an opportunity to refine my communication skills by tailoring my presentations to suit the needs of diverse audiences. This approach has not only enhanced my ability to convey information effectively but has also broadened my expertise in delivering impactful messages. I continue to seek opportunities to expand my knowledge, such as attending workshops on advanced communication techniques, to ensure I remain adaptable and dynamic in my field."
What are your outside interests?,"In my spare time, I am deeply involved in community service, particularly with Habitat for Humanity, where I serve on the board. This role has honed my leadership skills, as I coordinate various teams and projects, demonstrating my ability to manage and inspire a group effectively. Additionally, I am an avid runner and participate in marathons annually, which underscores my physical stamina and dedication to setting and achieving long-term goals. These activities not only enrich my personal life but also equip me with transferable skills that enhance my professional performance and contribute positively to a collaborative and dynamic work environment."
The Fatal Flaw question,"Certainly, I appreciate your direct approach in asking about potential shortcomings. One area that could be perceived as a flaw is my lack of formal certification in project management. However, this hasn't hindered my ability to deliver successful projects consistently. Throughout my career, I've tackled this by developing a robust skill set and a commitment to excellence, which have allowed me to lead teams effectively and surpass project goals. For instance, in my previous role, I spearheaded a complex project that was completed ahead of schedule and under budget, outperforming expectations despite not having the certification. My dedication to understanding the nuances of each project and my ability to adapt quickly have been key contributors to my success.

Moreover, I believe that my experience and track record align well with your organization's needs. I've worked hard to hone my skills in areas directly relevant to this position, such as team leadership, strategic planning, and resource management. This has enabled me to consistently deliver high-quality results that align with organizational goals. My focus is not on the lack of a certification but on how my practical experience can be leveraged to meet and exceed your expectations for this role."
"How do you feel about reporting to a younger person (minority, woman, etc)?","You greatly admire a company that hires and promotes on merit alone and you couldnt agree more with that philosophy. The age (gender, race, etc.) of the person you report to would certainly make no difference to you. Whoever has that position has obviously earned it and knows their job well. Both the person and the position are fully deserving of respect. You believe that all people in a company, from the receptionist to the Chairman, work best when their abilities, efforts and feelings are respected and rewarded fairly, and that includes you. Thats the best type of work environment you can hope to find."
On confidential matters...,"I appreciate your interest in understanding my experiences and insights from my previous roles. While I'm eager to share my achievements and the skills I've developed, I must respect the confidentiality agreements I have with my former employers. It's crucial for me to maintain the trust they've placed in me, just as you would expect from your team members in similar situations. However, I can certainly discuss the strategies and approaches I used that led to significant successes, without disclosing sensitive specifics. I believe maintaining integrity and trust is essential in any professional relationship, and I am committed to upholding these values."
Would you lie for the company?,"Try to avoid choosing between two values, giving a positive statement which covers all bases instead. Example: I would never do anything to hurt the company.. If aggressively pressed to choose between two competing values, always choose personal integrity. It is the most prized of all values."
"Looking back, what would you do differently in your life?","Indicate that you are a happy, fulfilled, optimistic person and that, in general, you wouldnt change a thing. Example: Its been a good life, rich in learning and experience, and the best it yet to come. Every experience in life is a lesson it its own way. I wouldnt change a thing."
Could you have done better in your last job?,"I believe that with the benefit of hindsight, there are always opportunities for improvement, but overall, I am satisfied with my performance in my last role. One situation that comes to mind was a strategic initiative to expand our market presence through a new product launch. Initially, the campaign showed promising results, but external factors such as unexpected shifts in consumer behavior and changes in the economic landscape led to outcomes that were not as strong as anticipated. While we couldn't predict these changes, we took valuable lessons from the experience that informed our future strategies. Despite the challenges, I am proud of how our team remained agile and responsive, adapting our approach to meet the evolving needs of the market."
Can you work under pressure?,Absolutely...(then prove it with a vivid example or two of a goal or project accomplished under severe pressure.)
What makes you angry?,"I'm naturally an even-tempered and positive person, which aligns well with the professional atmosphere of your company. I believe that maintaining a calm and communicative environment is essential for the smooth functioning of any department. Clear communication of goals and continuous follow-up are key to ensuring everyone is on track. If someone consistently fails to meet expectations without a valid reason, it can be frustrating. However, I focus on motivating the team towards excellence and address issues proactively to prevent any escalation. With the right team and approach, these situations are rare, allowing us to maintain a harmonious and productive workplace.

Alternatively, I'm someone who values hard work and honesty, which is crucial in a dynamic and demanding environment like yours. It angers me when people don't pull their weight or resort to negativity and deceit. Such traits can hinder team progress and morale. I believe in setting clear expectations and addressing any deviations promptly. By fostering a culture of accountability and transparency, we can minimize such challenges and ensure that the team remains focused and driven towards our collective goals."
Why arent you earning more money at this stage of your career?,"You like to make money, but other factors are even more important. Example: Making money is very important to me, and one reason Im here is because Im looking to make more. Throughout my career, whats been even more important to me is doing work I really like to do at the kind of company I like and respect. (Then be prepared to be specific about what your ideal position and company would be like, matching them as closely as possible to the opportunity at hand."
Who has inspired you in your life and why?,"One individual who has profoundly inspired me is Dr. Maya Angelou. Her resilience and unwavering commitment to authenticity, despite facing immense adversity, have taught me the importance of perseverance and self-expression. Her writings have been a guiding light, encouraging me to embrace my unique voice and to approach challenges with courage and grace. In my career, I strive to emulate her ability to transform obstacles into opportunities for growth and empowerment. This mindset aligns with the values of innovation and determination needed for the position I am seeking, where embracing change and inspiring others are essential to driving success.

Additionally, I am inspired by Elon Musk's visionary leadership and relentless pursuit of innovation. His ability to dream big and execute complex ideas is a testament to the importance of strategic thinking and adaptability. Musk's focus on sustainable solutions resonates with my passion for creating impactful change in the industry. His example has motivated me to push boundaries and think creatively, qualities that are crucial for excelling in this role and contributing to the company's forward-thinking initiatives."
What was the toughest decision you ever had to make?,"Be prepared with a good example, explaining why the decision was difficult...the process you followed in reaching it...the courageous or effective way you carried it out...and the beneficial results."
Tell me about the most boring job youve ever had.,"Fortunately, I've never found myself bored with any job I've held. I genuinely enjoy the challenge and satisfaction that come with hard work. Much like actors who believe there are no small parts, I see every role within a company or department as an opportunity to uncover exciting challenges and intriguing problems. By actively seeking out solutions and striving to contribute positively, I've managed to keep my work engaging and fulfilling. If boredom ever creeps in, I believe it's a signal to push myself further and explore the opportunities for growth and innovation that are often right in front of us."
Have you been absent from work more than a few days in any previous position?,"Throughout my career, I have maintained an excellent and consistent attendance record, which I believe is crucial for any key executive. Being present is essential not only for managing day-to-day operations but also for setting an example of dedication and commitment to the team. There's simply no substitute for being there with your people to keep the operation running smoothly, answer questions, and handle problems and crises as they arise. My presence has always been a priority to ensure that everything progresses seamlessly and efficiently.

Other than being out last year due to an unexpected medical condition, which has since been resolved, I have never had a problem with attendance and have enjoyed a stellar record throughout my career. Consistent attendance is important as it provides stability and reassurance to the team, allowing for effective communication and swift resolution of any issues. I am committed to being a reliable presence in the workplace to support my colleagues and contribute to the success of the organization."
What changes would you make if you came on board?,"You, of course, will want to take a good hard look at everything the company is doing before making any recommendations. Example: Well, I wouldnt be a very good doctor if I gave my diagnosis before the examination. Should you hire me, as I hope you will, Id want to take a good hard look at everything youre doing and understand why its being done that way. Id like to have in-depth meetings with you and the other key people to get a deeper grasp of what you feel youre doing right and what could be improved. From what youve told me so far, the areas of greatest concern to you are... (name them. Then do two things. First, ask if these are in fact his major concerns. If so then reaffirm how your experience in meeting similar needs elsewhere might prove very helpful)."
Im concerned that you dont have as much experience as wed like in...,"I understand your concern regarding my experience in [specific area]. This qualification is indeed important for the role, and I appreciate the opportunity to address it. While my resume may not fully reflect my expertise, I've had substantial hands-on experience through [specific projects or roles], which has allowed me to develop a strong understanding of the necessary skills. For instance, in my previous role at [Company Name], I led a project that involved [describe relevant experience], which honed my abilities in [specific skills]. Moreover, when you consider my strengths in [related area] and [another related area], it’s the combination of these skills that truly aligns with the needs of your company. I believe these strengths, along with my ability to quickly adapt and learn, will enable me to contribute effectively to [Company Name] and address your most pressing challenges in a unique and impactful way."
How do you feel about working nights and weekends?,"First, if youre a confirmed workaholic, this question is a softball lob. Whack it out of the park on the first swing by saying this kind of schedule is just your style. Add that your family understands it. Indeed, theyre happy for you, as they know you get your greatest satisfaction from your work. If however, you prefer a more balanced lifestyle, answer this question with another: Whats the norm for your best people here? If the hours still sound unrealistic for you, ask, Do you have any top people who perform exceptionally for you, but who also have families and like to get home in time to see them at night? Chances are this company does, and this associates you with this other top-performers-who-leave-not-later-than-six group. Depending on the answer, be honest about how you would fit into the picture. If all those extra hours make you uncomfortable, say so, but phrase your response positively. Example: I love my work and do it exceptionally well. I think the results speak for themselves, especially in ...(mention your two or three qualifications of greater interest to the employer. Remember, this is what he wants most, not a workaholic with weak credentials). Not only would I bring these qualities, but Ive built my whole career on working not just hard, but smart. I think youll find me one of the most productive people here. I do have a family who likes to see me after work and on weekends. They add balance and richness to my life, which in turn helps me be happy and productive at work. If I could handle some of the extra work at home in the evenings or on weekends, that would be ideal. Youd be getting a person of exceptional productivity who meets your needs with strong credentials. And Id be able to handle some of the heavy workload at home where I can be under the same roof as my family. Everybody would win."
Are you willing to relocate or travel?,"First find out where you may have to relocate and how much travel may be involved. Then respond to the question. If theres no problem, say so enthusiastically. If you do have a reservation, there are two schools of thought on how to handle it. One advises you to keep your options open and your reservations to yourself in the early going, by saying, no problem. You strategy here is to get the best offer you can, then make a judgment whether its worth it to you to relocate or travel. Also, by the time the offer comes through, you may have other offers and can make a more informed decision. Why kill of this opportunity before it has chance to blossom into something really special? And if youre a little more desperate three months from now, you might wish you hadnt slammed the door on relocating or traveling. The second way to handle this question is to voice a reservation, but assert that youd be open to relocating (or traveling) for the right opportunity. The answering strategy you choose depends on how eager you are for the job. If you want to take no chances, choose the first approach. If you want to play a little harder-to-get in hopes of generating a more enticing offer, choose the second."
Do you have the stomach to fire people? Have you had experience firing many people?,"Describe the rational and sensible management process you follow in both hiring and firing. Example: My whole management approach is to hire the best people I can find, train them thoroughly and well, get them excited and proud to be part of our team, and then work with them to achieve our goals together. If you do all of that right, especially hiring the right people, Ive found you dont have to fire very often. So with me, firing is a last resort. But when its got to be done, its got to be done, and the faster and cleaner, the better. A poor employee can wreak terrible damage in undermining the morale of an entire team of good people. When theres no other way, Ive found its better for all concerned to act decisively in getting rid of offenders who wont change their ways."
Why have you had so many jobs?,"Throughout my career, I've prioritized growth and skill development, which has led to a diverse range of experiences across several positions. Early on, I explored various roles to better understand my strengths and identify the right path for my long-term career goals. This exploration was essential in honing my skills and establishing a solid foundation for my future. For instance, I made strategic moves when faced with external changes such as mergers, ensuring I was always positioned for upward mobility and professional stability. Now, with a clearer vision of where I want to be, I'm focused on finding a role that offers longevity and aligns with my career aspirations, similar to the position where I stayed the longest and thrived."
What do you see as the proper role/mission of...,"Think of the most essential ingredients of success for each category above your job title, your role as manager, your firms role, etc. Identify at least three but no more than six qualities you feel are most important to success in each role. Then commit your response to memory. Here, again, the more information youve already drawn out about the greatest wants and needs of the interviewer, and the more homework youve done to identify the culture of the firm, the more on-target your answer will be."
"What would you say to your boss if hes crazy about an idea, but you think it stinks?","If my boss is enthusiastic about an idea that I have reservations about, I would first focus on the positive aspects of the idea to understand what makes it appealing and valuable. I would express my appreciation for the innovative approach and the potential benefits it might bring. Then, I would candidly share my concerns, ensuring that I present them with specific, objective, and factual reasoning. My aim would be to contribute constructively to the discussion, suggesting ways to refine the idea or address any potential weaknesses I perceive. This collaborative approach not only demonstrates my integrity and commitment to honesty but also shows my dedication to enhancing the idea's effectiveness and appeal. Ultimately, if my boss decides to proceed with his original plan, I would commit to supporting him fully, working enthusiastically to ensure its success."
How could you have improved your career progress?,"Youre generally quite happy with your career progress. Maybe, if you had known something earlier in life (impossible to know at the time, such as the booming growth in a branch in your industry...or the corporate downsizing that would phase out your last job), you might have moved in a certain direction sooner. But all things considered, you take responsibility for where you are, how youve gotten there, where you are going...and you harbor no regrets."
What would you do if a fellow executive on your own corporate level wasnt pulling his/her weight...and this was hurting your department?,"If I noticed that a fellow executive was not pulling their weight and it was impacting my department, my first step would be to address the issue directly with the individual. I would approach them in a respectful and constructive manner, explaining the situation and the challenges it presents to my team and the organization as a whole. My goal would be to enlist their help in finding a positive resolution, emphasizing the benefits that collaboration brings to our shared objectives and how it ultimately serves the company and our customers. If I encountered resistance, I would strive to be as persuasive as possible, highlighting the advantages of working together and the potential negative consequences of continued inaction.

Should the problem persist despite my efforts, I would not let it slide, as ignoring it could exacerbate the issue and set a poor precedent. I would continue to address the situation, exploring different approaches and involving wider circles of stakeholders, including higher-level executives and possibly my own supervisor if necessary. By engaging a broader group of individuals, I aim to foster a collective understanding of the importance of teamwork and cooperation. Throughout this process, my focus would remain on harnessing the collective efforts of others in a determined and constructive manner to ultimately resolve the issue."
Youve been with your firm a long time. Wont it be hard switching to a new company?,"During my time at my current firm, I've had the opportunity to grow significantly by adapting to various roles and challenges. For instance, I started in a junior position and gradually took on more responsibilities, such as managing projects and leading teams. Each of these experiences required me to learn quickly and adjust to new environments and expectations, which has made me adept at thriving amid change. I genuinely enjoy the stimulation that comes with tackling fresh challenges, which is why I'm excited about the opportunity to join your company.

Moreover, I've researched the new position, and I'm pleased to see how well my skills align with your needs. For example, the focus on strategic planning and team leadership mirrors the responsibilities I've handled successfully in my current role. This similarity gives me confidence that I can transition smoothly and contribute effectively to your team, ensuring that I will be comfortable and productive in this new setting from day one."
May I contact your present employer for a reference?,"My current employer is not aware of my job search, and I would prefer to keep it confidential for the time being. I hope you can understand the need to maintain privacy while I explore new opportunities. I am confident in my performance and contributions at my present role, and I would be happy to provide references from my previous positions or from colleagues who are aware of my career aspirations. Once we agree that the timing is appropriate, I would be comfortable with you reaching out to them for a reference. Thank you for your understanding."
"Give me an example of your creativity (analytical skill...managing ability, etc.)","Certainly! One of my most notable achievements was orchestrating a highly successful trade show last year. I was tasked with revitalizing our booth presence and maximizing attendee engagement. I employed my creativity by designing an interactive and visually striking booth that incorporated advanced digital elements such as virtual reality demos and touch screen product displays. To ensure the project ran smoothly, I utilized my analytical skills to assess attendee data from previous years and strategically plan our layout and presentations. Additionally, my managing ability was crucial in coordinating a team of designers, marketers, and sales representatives, ensuring everyone was aligned with our objectives. The result was a significant increase in foot traffic to our booth and a 30% boost in lead generation compared to previous years."
Where could you use some improvement?,"Keep this answer, like all your answers, positive. A good way to answer this question is to identify a cutting-edge branch of your profession (one thats not essential to your employers needs) as an area youre very excited about and want to explore more fully over the next six months."
What do you worry about?,"Redefine the word worry so that it does not reflect negatively on you. Example: I wouldnt call it worry, but I am a strongly goal-oriented person. So I keep turning over in my mind anything that seems to be keeping me from achieving those goals, until I find a solution. Thats part of my tenacity, I suppose."
How many hours a week do you normally work?,"I have always been someone who puts in long hours, and I find it difficult to keep track of the exact number because I genuinely enjoy the work I do. Solving problems is a passion of mine, and it's something I'm constantly thinking about, whether I'm at the office, at home, or even during my morning routine. This dedication goes with the territory, and it's a natural part of my life. The fulfillment I get from my work makes the time spent feel less like a job and more like a labor of love."
Whats the most difficult part of being a (job title)?,"First, redefine difficult to be challenging which is more positive. Then, identify an area everyone in your profession considers challenging and in which you excel. Describe the process you follow that enables you to get splendid results...and be specific about those results. Example: I think every sales manager finds it challenging to motivate the troops in a recession. But thats probably the strongest test of a top sales manager. I feel this is one area where I excel. When I see the first sign that sales may slip or that sales force motivation is flagging because of a downturn in the economy, heres the plan I put into action immediately... (followed by a description of each step in the process...and most importantly, the exceptional results youve achieved.)."
The Hypothetical Problem,"To tackle a hypothetical problem, I would begin by thoroughly understanding the issue at hand by gathering relevant information and defining the problem's scope. I would consult with stakeholders and team members to gain diverse perspectives and insights that could aid in formulating a comprehensive understanding. Once I have a clear grasp of the problem, I would brainstorm and generate a list of potential solutions, evaluating each option based on feasibility, impact, and alignment with organizational goals. After prioritizing these solutions, I would select the most viable course of action, ensuring that it is sustainable and scalable. I would then implement the solution while setting up key performance indicators to monitor its effectiveness and make adjustments as necessary. Throughout the process, I would maintain open communication with all involved parties to ensure transparency and foster collaboration."
What was the toughest challenge youve ever faced?,"One of the toughest challenges I faced was during a critical project at my previous job, where we had to deliver a complex software solution within a tight deadline. As the team leader, it was crucial for me to demonstrate effective leadership and coordination skills. The project involved multiple teams spread across different time zones, which made communication and collaboration challenging. I took the initiative to set up daily virtual stand-up meetings, ensuring everyone was aligned on the goals and progress. Additionally, I implemented a centralized digital platform for sharing updates and troubleshooting issues. Through persistence and strategic planning, we successfully delivered the project on time, exceeding client expectations and enhancing our team's reputation for reliability and effectiveness. This experience honed my ability to manage teams under pressure and reinforced my belief in the power of clear communication and teamwork."
Have you consider starting your own business?,"I have occasionally thought about starting my own business, but my career has predominantly been focused on thriving within larger organizations. I find that I excel in environments where I can leverage the resources and stability that such companies offer. My experience has taught me that these settings allow for significant personal and professional growth, and they align perfectly with my career goals. Therefore, I am committed to contributing to and growing within this type of corporate environment.

In a company like yours, which fosters innovation and encourages individual input, I see the perfect blend of entrepreneurial spirit and organizational support. This structure allows me to pursue my ideas and see them come to fruition while benefiting from the stability and resources provided by a well-established firm. It feels like an ideal environment for me to thrive and contribute meaningfully."
What are your goals?,"My career goal is to advance into a leadership role in the next five years, where I can leverage my skills in project management and team collaboration to drive impactful initiatives. I'm currently taking steps towards this by pursuing advanced certifications and seeking mentorship from experienced leaders in my field. On a personal development level, I'm committed to continuous learning, aiming to read at least two books per month on topics ranging from emotional intelligence to innovative business strategies. Family is equally important to me, and I strive to maintain a healthy work-life balance, dedicating weekends to quality time with loved ones and outdoor activities that promote physical health. In terms of community service, I volunteer monthly at a local food bank, which aligns with my value of giving back to the community. If spiritual goals are of interest, I aim to deepen my mindfulness practice through daily meditation, fostering a strong sense of inner peace and clarity. Each of these goals is structured with specific milestones and timeframes, ensuring that I stay focused and motivated in achieving them."
What do you for when you hire people?,"Speak your own thoughts here, but for the best answer weave them around the three most important qualifications for any position. 1. Can the person do the work (qualifications)? 2. Will the person do the work (motivation)? 3. Will the person fit in (our kind of team player)?"
Sell me this stapler...(this pencil...this clock...or some other object on interviewers desk).,"Of course, you already know the most important secret of all great salesmanship find out what people want, then show them how to get it. If your interviewer picks up his stapler and asks, sell this to me, you are going to demonstrate this proven master principle. Heres how: Well, a good salesman must know both his product and his prospect before he sells anything. If I were selling this, Id first get to know everything I could about it, all its features and benefits. Then, if my goal were to sell it you, I would do some research on how you might use a fine stapler like this. The best way to do that is by asking some questions. May I ask you a few questions? Then ask a few questions such as, Just out of curiosity, if you didnt already have a stapler like this, why would you want one? And in addition to that? Any other reason? Anything else? And would you want such a stapler to be reliable?...Hold a good supply of staples? (Ask more questions that point to the features this stapler has.) Once youve asked these questions, make your presentation citing all the features and benefits of this stapler and why its exactly what the interviewer just told you hes looking for. Then close with, Just out of curiosity, what would you consider a reasonable price for a quality stapler like this...a stapler you could have right now and would (then repeat all the problems the stapler would solve for him)? Whatever he says, (unless its zero), say, Okay, weve got a deal. NOTE: If your interviewer tests you by fighting every step of the way, denying that he even wants such an item, dont fight him. Take the product away from him by saying, Mr. Prospect, Im delighted youve told me right upfront that theres no way youd ever want this stapler. As you well know, the first rule of the most productive salespeople in any field is to meet the needs of people who really need and want our products, and it just wastes everyones time if we try to force it on those who dont. And I certainly wouldnt want to waste your time. But we sell many items. Is there any product on this desk you would very much like to own...just one item? When he points something out, repeat the process above. If he knows anything about selling, he may give you a standing ovation."
The Salary Question How much money do you want?,"Thank you for asking about the salary, but I believe it’s important to first ensure that I am the right fit for the company and the position. My primary focus is on the opportunity for growth and the potential to contribute meaningfully to your team. Could we discuss the responsibilities and expectations for this role further before we delve into financials? Once we establish a mutual fit, I’m confident we can agree on a compensation that reflects my abilities and the value I bring to the company.

Once we’re both confident that my skills and experience align well with the needs of this position, I would appreciate knowing the salary range the company has established for this role. I'm sure it's set to reflect the value and contributions expected. My aim is to ensure that it’s a fair and rewarding compensation package, commensurate with my qualifications and the industry standards."
The Illegal Question,"Under the ever-present threat of lawsuits, most interviewers are well aware of these taboos. Yet you may encounter, usually on a second or third interview, a senior executive who doesnt interview much and forgets he cant ask such questions. You can handle an illegal question in several ways. First, you can assert your legal right not to answer. But this will frighten or embarrass your interviewer and destroy any rapport you had. Second, you could swallow your concerns over privacy and answer the question straight forwardly if you feel the answer could help you. For example, your interviewer, a devout Baptist, recognizes you from church and mentions it. Here, you could gain by talking about your church. Third, if you dont want your privacy invaded, you can diplomatically answer the concern behind the question without answering the question itself. Example: If you are over 50 and are asked, How old are you? you can answer with a friendly, smiling question of your own on whether theres a concern that your age my affect your performance. Follow this up by reassuring the interviewer that theres nothing in this job you cant do and, in fact, your age and experience are the most important advantages you offer the employer for the following reasons... Another example: If asked, Do you plan to have children? you could answer, I am wholeheartedly dedicated to my career, perhaps adding, I have no plans regarding children. (You neednt fear youve pledged eternal childlessness. You have every right to change your plans later. Get the job first and then enjoy all your options.) Most importantly, remember that illegal questions arise from fear that you wont perform well. The best answer of all is to get the job and perform brilliantly. All concerns and fears will then varnish, replaced by respect and appreciation for your work."
The Secret Illegal Question,"Certainly! Throughout my career as a sales representative, I've consistently exceeded my targets and built strong relationships with clients across various regions. My commitment to excellence and my strategic approach to networking have allowed me to effectively manage extensive territories, ensuring that I meet clients' needs with precision and care. Traveling has been a fundamental part of my role, and I have always thrived in dynamic environments, adapting quickly to new challenges and opportunities. My track record speaks to my ability to maintain high energy levels and dedication, enabling me to consistently deliver exceptional results despite any obstacles."
What was the toughest part of your last job?,"State that there was nothing in your prior position that you found overly difficult, and let your answer go at that. If pressed to expand your answer, you could describe the aspects of the position you enjoyed more than others, making sure that you express maximum enjoyment for those tasks most important to the open position, and you enjoyed least those tasks that are unimportant to the position at hand."
How do you define success...and how do you measure up to your own definition?,"Give a well-accepted definition of success that leads right into your own stellar collection of achievements. Example: The best definition Ive come across is that success is the progressive realization of a worthy goal. As to how I would measure up to that definition, I would consider myself both successful and fortunate...(Then summarize your career goals and how your achievements have indeed represented a progressive path toward realization of your goals.)"
The Opinion Question What do you think about ...Abortion...The President...The Death Penalty...(or any other controversial subject)?,"When faced with such controversial topics, it's always intriguing to explore the underlying reasons for the inquiry. So, I might initially respond with, ""Why do you ask?"" This approach often provides insight into the interviewer’s perspective and allows me to gauge the context of the discussion. If the conversation continues and requires a more direct response, I might offer a neutral observation, such as, ""These are complex issues, and it's fascinating how diverse opinions can be. It's a testament to the complexity of human experiences and perspectives."" This strategy not only deflects the pressure to take a definitive stance but also emphasizes a broader understanding and appreciation for differing viewpoints."
"If you won $10 million lottery, would you still work?","If I were fortunate enough to win a $10 million lottery, after the initial excitement settled, I would still hold onto my fundamental belief that meaningful work is crucial to a fulfilling life. Achieving goals and contributing positively through my career are deeply rewarding experiences for me. While financial freedom would provide more flexibility and opportunities, it wouldn't replace the sense of purpose and accomplishment that comes from working. I am passionate about what I do, and I envision continuing to engage with my career in some capacity, even if it meant exploring new avenues or projects. Ultimately, I believe that hard work and a strong drive to achieve have been the cornerstones of many successful endeavors, far surpassing the fleeting luck of winning a lottery."
"Looking back on your last position, have you done your best work?","Absolutely, I always strive to do my best work, and I believe the best of my career is happening right now. Much like an athlete at the peak of their performance, I feel I'm hitting my career stride due to a combination of experience, continuous learning, and a deep commitment to my professional development. My recent accomplishments, including spearheading successful projects and mentoring emerging talent, reflect the expertise and leadership skills I've honed over the years. Additionally, my adaptability and proficiency in the latest industry technologies have empowered me to deliver innovative solutions and drive tangible results. These factors, along with my dedication to excellence, position me to contribute effectively and make a positive impact in my next role."
Why should I hire you from the outside when I could promote someone from within?,"Help him see the qualifications that only you can offer. Example: In general, I think its a good policy to hire from within to look outside probably means youre not completely comfortable choosing someone from inside. Naturally, you want this department to be as strong as it possibly can be, so you want the strongest candidate. I feel that I can fill that bill because...(then recap your strongest qualifications that match up with his greatest needs)."
Tell me something negative youve heard about our company...,"I have heard that, like many successful companies experiencing rapid growth, you face challenges in maintaining efficient communication across all departments. However, I see this as an opportunity where your commitment to innovation and improvement can shine. The way your company is actively addressing this challenge by investing in new communication tools and fostering a culture of open dialogue is truly commendable. It reflects a proactive approach to ensuring that everyone stays connected and aligned with the company goals, which is something I admire and am eager to contribute to if given the chance."
"On a scale of one to ten, rate me as an interviewer.","I truly appreciate the approach you have taken during this interview process. Your methodical and analytical style has allowed for a comprehensive exploration of my experiences and skills, and I can see how this meticulous approach would be instrumental in securing excellent hires for your firm. The thoughtful and structured way you’ve guided this conversation has not only made me feel comfortable but also challenged me to reflect deeply on my professional journey. Thank you for conducting such a thorough and engaging interview."
