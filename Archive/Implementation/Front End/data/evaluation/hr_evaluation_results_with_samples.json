Currently, I am working as a project coordinator at XYZ Corp, where I have successfully led several key initiatives to streamline operations and enhance team collaboration. This experience has honed my skills in project management, communication, and strategic planning, all of which are integral to the position we're discussing today. However, before I dive deeper into my qualifications, I would love to gain a clearer understanding of the specific priorities and goals you have for this role. This way, I can ensure that my background aligns closely with your needs. Could you share more about what the most critical aspects of this position are? Additionally, are there any particular challenges or objectives that need immediate attention or long-term focus? \n\nOnce I understand your priorities better, I can share examples of how I've successfully tackled similar challenges in my past roles. For instance, if problem-solving and adaptability are crucial, I can elaborate on how I developed a contingency plan that reduced project delays by 30% during a major system upgrade. I'm eager to connect my experiences and skills directly to the success of your team and organization.",

    "question": "What are your greatest weaknesses?",
    "raw_answer": "(and another reason it's so important to get a thorough description of your interviewer's needs before you answer questions): Assure the interviewer that you can think of nothing that would stand in the way of your performing in this position with excellence. Then, quickly review you strongest qualifications. Example: Nobody's perfect, but based on what you've told me about this position, I believe I' d make an outstanding match. I know that when I hire people, I look for two things most of all. Do they have the qualifications to do the job well, and the motivation to do it well? Everything in my background shows I have both the qualifications and a strong desire to achieve excellence in whatever I take on. So I can say in all honesty that I see nothing that would cause you even a small concern about my ability or my strong desire to perform this job with excellence. Alternate strategy (if you don't yet know enough about the position to talk about such a perfect fit): Instead of confessing a weakness, describe what you like most and like least, making sure that what you like most matches up with the most important qualification for success in the position, and what you like least is not essential. Example: Let's say you're applying for a teaching position. If given a choice, I like to spend as much time as possible in front of my prospects selling, as opposed to shuffling paperwork back at the office. Of course, I long ago learned the importance of filing paperwork properly, and I do it conscientiously. But what I really love to do is sell (if your interviewer were a sales manager, this should be music to his ears.)",

I also like to make each person feel like a member of an elite team, akin to the Boston Celtics or LA Lakers in their prime. I've found that when you let each team member know you expect excellence in their performance, work hard to set an example yourself, and make it clear that you appreciate and respect their feelings, it results in a highly motivated group.

I believe that I know the right contacts, methods, principles, and successful management techniques as well as any person can in our industry. You also need someone who can expand your book distribution channels. In my prior post, my innovative promotional ideas doubled, then tripled, the number of outlets selling our books. Im confident I can do the same for you. You need someone to give a new shot in the arm to your mail order sales, someone who knows how to sell in space and direct mail media. Here, too, I believe I have exactly the experience you need. In the last five years, Ive increased our mail order book sales from $600,000 to $2,800,000, and now were the countrys second leading marketer of scientific and medical books by mail.

    "question": "Arent you overqualified for this position?",
    "raw_answer": "As with any objection, dont view this as a sign of imminent defeat. Its an invitation to teach the interviewer a new way to think about this situation, seeing advantages instead of drawbacks. Example: I recognize the job market for what it is a marketplace. Like any marketplace, its subject to the laws of supply and demand. So overqualified can be a relative term, depending on how tight the job market is. And right now, its very tight. I understand and accept that. I also believe that there could be very positive benefits for both of us in this match. Because of my unusually strong experience in ________________ , I could start to contribute right away, perhaps much faster than someone whod have to be brought along more slowly. Theres also the value of all the training and years of experience that other companies have invested tens of thousands of dollars to give me. Youd be getting all the value of that without having to pay an extra dime for it. With someone who has yet to acquire that experience, hed have to gain it on your nickel. I could also help you in many things they dont teach at the Harvard Business School. For example...(how to hire, train, motivate, etc.) When it comes to knowing how to work well with people and getting the most out of them, theres just no substitute for what you learn over many years of front-line experience. You company would gain all this, too. From my side, there are strong benefits, as well. Right now, I am unemployed. I want to work, very much, and the position you have here is exactly what I love to do and am best at. Ill be happy doing this work and thats what matters most to me, a lot more that money or title. Most important, Im looking to make a long term commitment in my career now. Ive had enough of job-hunting and want a permanent spot at this point in my career. I also know that if I perform this job with excellence, other opportunities cannot help but open up for me right here. In time, Ill find many other ways to help this company and in so doing, help myself. I really am looking to make a long-term commitment. NOTE: The main concern behind the overqualified question is that you will leave your new employer as soon as something better comes your way. Anything you can say to demonstrate the sincerity of your commitment to the employer and reassure him that youre looking to stay for the long-term will help you overcome this objection.",

Consider it part of the work of your job search to read up on a few of these leading books. But make sure they are quality books that reflect favorably upon you, nothing that could even remotely be considered superficial. Finally, add a recently published bestselling work of fiction by a world-class author and youll pass this question with flying colors.",

While I strive for perfection, I am always open to suggestions for improvement. Early in my career, I received feedback about my time management skills. I was working on multiple projects and occasionally found it challenging to prioritize tasks effectively. This constructive criticism prompted me to explore strategies for better organization, such as using project management tools and setting clear milestones. As a result, my ability to manage my workload has become one of my strongest skills, contributing to my efficiency and effectiveness in my roles. \n\nIn a more recent position, I received feedback on my presentation style, which was deemed slightly too detailed for certain audiences. While this was not critical to my overall success, I took it as an opportunity to refine my communication skills by tailoring my presentations to suit the needs of diverse audiences. This approach has not only enhanced my ability to convey information effectively but has also broadened my expertise in delivering impactful messages. I continue to seek opportunities to expand my knowledge, such as attending workshops on advanced communication techniques, to ensure I remain adaptable and dynamic in my field.",

It angers me when people don't pull their weight or resort to negativity and deceit. Such traits can hinder team progress and morale. I believe in setting clear expectations and addressing any deviations promptly.

    "raw_answer": "First, if youre a confirmed workaholic, this question is a softball lob. Whack it out of the park on the first swing by saying this kind of schedule is just your style. Add that your family understands it. Indeed, theyre happy for you, as they know you get your greatest satisfaction from your work. If however, you prefer a more balanced lifestyle, answer this question with another: Whats the norm for your best people here? If the hours still sound unrealistic for you, ask, Do you have any top people who perform exceptionally for you, but who also have families and like to get home in time to see them at night? Chances are this company does, and this associates you with this other top-performers-who-leave-not-later-than-six group. Depending on the answer, be honest about how you would fit into the picture. If all those extra hours make you uncomfortable, say so, but phrase your response positively. Example: I love my work and do it exceptionally well. I think the results speak for themselves, especially in ...(mention your two or three qualifications of greater interest to the employer. Remember, this is what he wants most, not a workaholic with weak credentials). Not only would I bring these qualities, but Ive built my whole career on working not just hard, but smart. I think youll find me one of the most productive people here. I do have a family who likes to see me after work and on weekends. They add balance and richness to my life, which in turn helps me be happy and productive at work. If I could handle some of the extra work at home in the evenings or on weekends, that would be ideal. Youd be getting a person of exceptional productivity who meets your needs with strong credentials. And Id be able to handle some of the heavy workload at home where I can be under the same roof as my family. Everybody would win.",

You strategy here is to get the best offer you can, then make a judgment whether its worth it to you to relocate or travel. Also, by the time the offer comes through, you may have other offers and can make a more informed decision. Why kill of this opportunity before it has chance to blossom into something really special? And if youre a little more desperate three months from now, you might wish you hadnt slammed the door on relocating or traveling. The second way to handle this question is to voice a reservation, but assert that youd be open to relocating (or traveling) for the right opportunity.

    "question": "What would you do if a fellow executive on your own corporate level wasnt pulling his/her weight...and this was hurting your department?",
    "raw_answer": "If I noticed that a fellow executive was not pulling their weight and it was impacting my department, my first step would be to address the issue directly with the individual. I would approach them in a respectful and constructive manner, explaining the situation and the challenges it presents to my team and the organization as a whole. My goal would be to enlist their help in finding a positive resolution, emphasizing the benefits that collaboration brings to our shared objectives and how it ultimately serves the company and our customers. If I encountered resistance, I would strive to be as persuasive as possible, highlighting the advantages of working together and the potential negative consequences of continued inaction.\n\nShould the problem persist despite my efforts, I would not let it slide, as ignoring it could exacerbate the issue and set a poor precedent. I would continue to address the situation, exploring different approaches and involving wider circles of stakeholders, including higher-level executives and possibly my own supervisor if necessary. By engaging a broader group of individuals, I aim to foster a collective understanding of the importance of teamwork and cooperation. Throughout this process, my focus would remain on harnessing the collective efforts of others in a determined and constructive manner to ultimately resolve the issue.",

    "question": "The Illegal Question",
    "raw_answer": "Under the ever-present threat of lawsuits, most interviewers are well aware of these taboos. Yet you may encounter, usually on a second or third interview, a senior executive who doesnt interview much and forgets he cant ask such questions. You can handle an illegal question in several ways. First, you can assert your legal right not to answer. But this will frighten or embarrass your interviewer and destroy any rapport you had. Second, you could swallow your concerns over privacy and answer the question straight forwardly if you feel the answer could help you. For example, your interviewer, a devout Baptist, recognizes you from church and mentions it. Here, you could gain by talking about your church. Third, if you dont want your privacy invaded, you can diplomatically answer the concern behind the question without answering the question itself. Example: If you are over 50 and are asked, How old are you? you can answer with a friendly, smiling question of your own on whether theres a concern that your age my affect your performance. Follow this up by reassuring the interviewer that theres nothing in this job you cant do and, in fact, your age and experience are the most important advantages you offer the employer for the following reasons... Another example: If asked, Do you plan to have children? you could answer, I am wholeheartedly dedicated to my career, perhaps adding, I have no plans regarding children. (You neednt fear youve pledged eternal childlessness. You have every right to change your plans later. Get the job first and then enjoy all your options.) Most importantly, remember that illegal questions arise from fear that you wont perform well. The best answer of all is to get the job and perform brilliantly. All concerns and fears will then varnish, replaced by respect and appreciation for your work.",
