think about my audience as general specialists in AI but in in my concrete project, they are not experts about the system, do not start with the history

why do I think this is necessary to be analyzed or researched, investigated

what is the problem statement

What are the research questions I want to solve

Skip any literature review

after the research question I will say okay my methodology to solve this is the following and then I showt the full pipeline How I solve it

for every part present only the best solution I found, I can mention that I did a lot of different trials and I tested out diff models but these parameters,complexity and all details of the model was the best

explain why I did those trials till reached the best

after reporting the results I will have crtical analysis , I will say okay these are my findings , the most important findings I have is this and this an .. etc compared with papers from other resources and these are alsothe limitations 

since is interview so related to personal data I should have one slide about the ethical concerns and how I will meet these concerns in future how privacy will be protected even I don't have this now in my solution I can say this must be done if it will put in cloud 

only select 4-5 papers that really investigated my project and research the most importan which I really used in my work

I need between 1.5 and 2 minutes per slide 

I should also include in the conclusion slide how each research question was solved and in what way




Poster
use visual abstract have a look in ieee journals on 2025 to see examples (IEEE access), visualize the approach and results and the pipeline thse are results of competitor and these are my results


question

why the curve is unstable here
